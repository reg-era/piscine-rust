# ðŸ¦€ Rust Piscine â€“ Monthâ€‘Long Intensive Course

Welcome to the **Rust Piscine** milestone repository! This project represents my journey through a one-month intensive Rust training, during which I completed all assigned exercises, mastered core concepts, and built a portfolio of Rust-based solutions.
I tackled progressively challenging exercises that reinforced memory safety, concurrency, error handling, and moreâ€”all with hands-on coding.
